# Sorting Hat Webapp
# Use the Sorting Hat Web app to randomly select a 'House' for each student who has been generated.

* You must use Boostrap 4 to style your page components.
* You should apply responsive design to your page (aka your app should be designed to work on small screens)
* Your JS file should be comprised of functions, no actions should happen in your code outside of a function
* Your HTML and JS should all have proper indentations

## You should make cards/tickets based on deliverable features, i.e. sorting hat jumbotron with get started button, click event to show form, sorting event to clear form and print student, expel student event.

### When ready, the user can click the "Lets Get Started" button.  A drop down box will appear and there the user
### can enter a student name.  Once entered, user can click the "Sort!" button.  This is where the users input will
### be sorted int a random house from the Harry Potter movie.
