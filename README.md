# Sorting Hat Webapp
Use the Sorting Hat Web app to randomly select a 'House' for each student who has been generated.

* You must use Boostrap 4 to style your page components.
* You should apply responsive design to your page (aka your app should be designed to work on small screens)
* Your JS file should be comprised of functions, no actions should happen in your code outside of a function
* Your HTML and JS should all have proper indentations

## You should make cards/tickets based on deliverable features, i.e. sorting hat jumbotron with get started button, click event to show form, sorting event to clear form and print student, expel student event.
